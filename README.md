# POEM
format for Problem-Oriented Exchangeable Mechanism

## Introduction

POEM is meant to design an efficient mechanism for exchange problem sets over multiple Online Judge providers. The mechanism shall be free from certain programming languages or certain frameworks. Scheduled supporting languages are PHP, Python, and Node.js but we hold an open arm for third-party Pull Requests.

NOJ would be the first for using POEM, we would integrate it over 0.3.1. It would be partially used for problem import and outport. We also scheduled a cross-platform POEM Editor/Viewer, having the function to view, edit or even upload problems to NOJ.
